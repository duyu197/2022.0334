## Description

This repository provides data for the problem and scripts for the models.

The main folders are 'data', 'src', 'scripts', and 'results'.
- '[data](data)': This folder includes minimum sum graph coloring data sets.
- '[src](src)': Our metaheuristic solver Q-Card can be found in this folder.
- '[scripts](scripts)': This folder provides a running script.
- '[results](results)': This folder provides the results.

## Building

This directory includes the [scripts](scripts) for generating and solving four models using Gurobi.

The following packages should be installed before you run our model.

```
python >= 3.8.13
gurobi >=9.5
```
## Results

The [results](results) folder show the tables reported in the paper.

[Table 1](results/Table%201.pdf) shows characteristic of tested data.

[Table 2](results/Table%202.pdf) presents the computational results of four models using exact solver Gurobi.

[Table 3](results/Table%203.pdf) shows the comparison results of four models using Exact and Metaheuristic Solvers.
